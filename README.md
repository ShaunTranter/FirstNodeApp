# FirstNodeApp
A simple application that cycles through DB entries where you can update fields using node.js and SQL  


The .env file was left in to show you where you put the database connection. The file structure uses a basic MVC structure seperatingg your server from public files.

This app was made to demo how a slider would work (Basic form) in a node.js app using vanilla javascript, that showed bridge defects in a database. You can cycle through
the entries and update their note and type and it will save the entry to the database when you click off the page.
